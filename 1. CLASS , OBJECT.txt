theory -

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class contains fields (variables) and
methods (functions) that define the behavior of an object. An object is an instance of a class.


Key Concepts:
 A class defines structure and behavior.
 An object is created using the new keyword.
 Objects can access fields and methods of the class.
